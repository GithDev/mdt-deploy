# Schedule MDT deployments via a website.

A simple tool to start MDT deployments remote, with schedules.

## Why?
I was working as a consultant at a training centre and was responsible for computer deployments. The problem was that the **class often ended late and a new class in the same room had to be prepared the next morning**. So, I made this tool to **schedule installations remote that could be triggered late at night, on weekends and so on**. That way I didn´t have to work outside office hours and could work more efficient.

## What else?
I added some comments so that other can understand some of what is happening in the code. I didn´t have much time when I made this tool, so it may not be very pretty.
